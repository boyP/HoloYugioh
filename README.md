## HoloYugioh

Playing Yu-Gi-Oh the way it should be played: holographic monsters, duel disks, and physical cards. 

### Technology
We use the Microsoft Hololens to display the holographic field and we use an Android app for player control and game flow.

### Current Update
We currently have holographic cards displaying on the field for both the player and the opponent. The player and opponent can place new cards, change the position and remove existing cards using the app. We are currently working on improving the user experience on both the app and on the hololens.
